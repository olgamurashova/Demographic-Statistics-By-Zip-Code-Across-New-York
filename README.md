## Demographic Statistics By Zip Code NY

### Project information

In this project, I analyzed demographic statistics across New York State broken down by zip code. The data has been provided by Department of Youth and Community Development (DYCD). The source data is available [here](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Demographic-Statistics-By-Zip-Code/kku6-nxdu). To manipulate the dataset, I used SQL and Python syntax. The dataset and results are included in the repository.
